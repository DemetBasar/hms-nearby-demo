 Several samples show how to use the APIs of the Nearby Service. The project directory is as follows:
1. NearbyConnection: The package contains an Android Studio project that provides a sample for Connection.
2. NearbyFriends: The package contains an Android Studio project that provides a sample for App-based Message Publishing and Subscription.
3. NearbyCanteens: The package contains an Android Studio project that provides a sample for Beacon-based Message Publishing and Subscription.

## Precautions
The project contains multiple independent projects. After downloading code, you can open a project in Android Studio to build your app or add multiple apps to a project. You do not have to create a separate project for each app. You can open setting.gradle to select the project to build.
